"""Queen identity profiles -- static queen personas stored as YAML files.

Each queen has a unique identity (Head of Technology, Head of Growth, etc.)
stored in ``~/.hive/agents/queens/{queen_id}/profile.yaml``. Profiles are
initialized with rich defaults and can be edited via the API.

At session start, a lightweight LLM classifier selects the best-matching
queen for the user's request, and the profile is injected into the system
prompt.
